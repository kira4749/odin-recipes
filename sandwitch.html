    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a delicious sandwich that went over with a bang at a luncheon. A few 'secret' ingredients and this is a perfect combination for a slightly unique sandwich.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 slices multigrain bread </li>
        <li>2 cooked chicken breasts, sliced </li>
        <li>1 ripe avocado, sliced </li>
        <li>8 slices cooked bacon </li>
        <li>2 hard boiled eggs, chopped </li>
        <li>4 lettuce leaves </li>
        <li>Â¼ cup blue cheese dressing </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the sandwich spread by mixing together the mayonnaise and blue cheese dressing. Spread 2 tablespoons on one side of each slice of bread. Top 4 of the prepared pieces of bread with 1/4 each of the chicken, avocado, bacon, hard boiled eggs, and lettuce. Top each sandwich with another slice of bread and serve with the remaining blue cheese spread on the side.</li>
    </ol>
